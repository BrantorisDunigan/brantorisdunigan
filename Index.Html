Phishing is a form of fraud which the attacker uses to get links to hack websites. Flaming is the way people communicate by using insulted words known as cursing words. Spamming is the way you can send an unsolicited message that nobody can star 69 back on. They all have their similarities they all are through the internet and itâ€™s all communicating on a device no matter what you do. Doing all this things take a lot of work especially when you are trying to be the perfect spamming person. If there were no internet and hackers there would be no spamming just only for the people who made a website or so on and so on.
